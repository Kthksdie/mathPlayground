## Structure

This repository contains two main implementations:

### [`/cs`](./cs)
The C# .NET workspace containing prototypes and experiments that I've done myself to explore number properties, sequences, and advanced factorization patterns.

#### Projects
-   **`PowersOfPrimes`**: A mathematical research project focused on discovering and testing prime numbers of specific forms, particularly those related to powers of integers.
-   **`Numberality.Con`**: The original console prototype containing initial experiments and "Trails" (versions) of the algorithm.
-   **`TestingNumbers`**: An extensive test suite for exploring number properties, sequences, and advanced factorization patterns.
-   **`PrimeNumbers`**: A mathematical research project focused on discovering and testing prime numbers.

### [`/python`](./python)
The python workspace containing prototypes and experiments that I've done utilizing AI to explore number properties, sequences, and advanced factorization patterns.

#### Projects
-   **`reverseMultiply.py`**: A CLI-based port of the core logic from C# [`/cs/Numberality.Con/Components/ReverseMultiply.cs`](./cs/Numberality.Con/Components/ReverseMultiply.cs)

-   **`unmultiply.py`**: A CLI-based port of the core logic from C# [`/cs/Numberality.Con/Components/Unmultiply.cs`](./cs/Numberality.Con/Components/Unmultiply.cs)
